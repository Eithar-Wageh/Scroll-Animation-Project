# Scroll-Animation-Project
# Scroll Animation Project 🌙🚤🌅

A fun **scroll-based animation** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project animates the background scene (stars, moon, river, mountains, and boat) as the user scrolls the page, creating a smooth **day & night transition**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🌟 Stars move horizontally while scrolling.
- 🌙 Moon moves down faster to simulate rising.
- 🏔️ Mountains and river shift to give depth (parallax effect).
- 🚤 Boat moves across the river smoothly.
- 🌅 Dynamic text changes:
  - Shows “happy new night” at night.
  - Changes to “HAPPY NEW DAY” during the day.
- 🎨 Background color gradient changes between **night** and **day**.
- ⬆️ Smooth fade effect: text disappears after further scrolling.
